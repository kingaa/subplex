\title{Subplex unconstrained optimization algorithm}
\description{
The \pkg{subplex} package implements Tom Rowan's subspace-searching simplex
algorithm for unconstrained minimization of a function.
}
\details{
Subplex is a subspace-searching simplex method for the unconstrained
optimization of general multivariate functions. Like the Nelder-Mead simplex
method it generalizes, the subplex method is well suited for optimizing
noisy objective functions. The number of function evaluations required for
convergence typically increases only linearly with the problem size, so for
most applications the subplex method is much more efficient than the simplex
method.

Subplex was written in FORTRAN by Tom Rowan (Oak Ridge National Laboratory).
The FORTRAN source code is maintained on the netlib repository
at \url{https://www.netlib.org/opt/subplex.tgz}.
