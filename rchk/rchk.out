Note: Setting PKG_ROOT variable to the current directory.
Output will be in ./lib, ./build and ./libsonly subdirectories.
If it is not, maybe your local singularity configuration does
not allow singularity container to access your current directory;
it may help to try with PKG_ROOT=/tmp or check the configurarion.


The container cannot access package tarball /userdata/kingaa/projects/Rpkg/subplex/subplex_1.8.3.tar.gz.
Please specify it as full path.
